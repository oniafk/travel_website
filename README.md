# Next + Tailwind CSS + TypeScript landing page for a traveling agency

this is an amazing project that I have been working on for a while now, it is a landing page for a traveling agency, it is built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript.

## Technologies

- React
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
